**Degree Program:** BS Computer Science <br/>

**Description**
- I made a database that is initially empty, and my program includes a save function responsible for adding student information to it. Then, I have implemented functions to update data, find a student by ID, retrieve all student data, delete a single student data, and remove all records from the database.

**How to Use**
- install independencies
- Since the test.js file already includes functions utilizing needle for GET and POST requests, users can modify the data to add student data and use the other functionalities to update, search, or delete a student data or all records in the database.
